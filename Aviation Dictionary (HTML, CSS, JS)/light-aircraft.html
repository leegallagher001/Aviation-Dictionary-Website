        <p>In the topic of aviation, the main stars of the show are of course the commercial and military types. After all, what plane-spotter doesn't involve watching a Boeing 737 or Airbus A380 coming in to land at their local airport (all the more exciting on a windy day!) or going to an air show and watching and hearing the roar of jet engines as a Eurofighter Typhoon or the Red Arrows does a thrilling display.</p>
        <p>However, for this page, I've decided to do a section on the different types of light aircraft that can be found out there. A few of these types have commercial uses, typically the larger end of the "light" scale, however for most of these examples, their main purpose is recreation or pilot training.</p>
        <p>Having a private pilot's licence myself (an NPPL(A) with a Microlight class rating to be exact - the types of pilot licences out there could be a whole section in itself!) I am somewhat biased in my appreciation for these types, since I have direct flying experience with a few of them. However, when you delve into it, I think the field of lighter aircraft types is a lot more interesting and diverse than one may think at first glance.</p>
        <h4>LIGHT AIRCRAFT</h4>
        <p>For most people, the most common image that springs to mind when thinking about "light aircraft" is that of a small, single-engine propeller plane such as a Cessna 172 (a floatplane version of which is pictured to the side) or a Piper PA-28. These typically have 2-4 seats and can fly a few hundred miles at an average speed of 90-130 knots. If you have ever went on holiday, chances are that your pilots first learned to fly on one of these types.</p>
        <p>A primary purpose of many of these types is that of a trainer, particularly the 2-seat types such as the Cessna 152. They are designed to be passively stable, docile and easy to fly for someone who is just beginning their flight training. Of course, these attribute serve these aircraft well in their role as recreational machines as well. These characteristics also make some of these types ideal for touring and cross-country flying, travelling from one airfield to another for a "$100 cheeseburger flight" (an endearing term that pilots have come up with to describe a day out flying, to emphasise that whilst flying is the most enjoyable of hobbies, it certainly isn't the cheapest).</p>
        <p>Most modern light aircraft have a tricycle configuration landing gear, with two main wheels at the sides and a nose-wheel in the centre in front of the two mains. However, some light aircraft, particularly older types such as the Piper J-3 Cub and types designed for bush flying, maintain a "tail-dragger" configuration, with two main wheels and a tailwheel at the rear. These types are somewhat harder to fly but offer some advantages such as greater ground clearance for the propeller, more space for the engine (no need to attach a nose-wheel assembly) and slightly less drag compared to a tricycle gear.</p>
        <h4>AEROBATIC AIRCRAFT</h4>
        <p>For recreational flyers looking for more excitement and aspiring military pilots, some light aircraft types are specifically built for performing stunts known as aerobatics. Anyone who has seen some of these types perform at an air show will have an idea of how impressive some of these types of aircraft can be and the kinds of stunts they can pull off.</p>
        <p>A lot of aerobatic light aircraft are of the tail-dragger configuration mentioned earlier, and are often built from very carefully crafted carbon fibre. Some examples of these types include the Extra 200 & 300, the Zivko Edge 540 and the GB1 Gamebird. These aircraft can fly at around 200 knots and call pull g-forces of up to +/- 10g (ten times the force of gravity) or even more in some instances. To put that into perspective, someone who is 80kg would feel like they weighed 800kg if they were pulling +10g.</p>
        <p>These aircraft typically feature 1-2 seats, often having variants of each within the same type, and are a popular choice for aerobatic teams and display pilots at air shows.</p>
        <h4>MICROLIGHTS</h4>
        <p>Otherwise known as Light Sport Aircraft or ultralights in other parts of the world, in the UK, microlight aircraft are 1-2 seat aircraft that are extremely light, with the original criteria for a UK microlight being an aircraft weighing 450kg maximum take-off weight (MTOW) or less, although this has recently been increased to 600kg.</p>
        <p>Microlight aircraft can trace their origins back to hang gliders, with some inventive hang glider pilots deciding that adding a tiny propeller engine to the back of a hang glider would greatly increase their capacity for longer and further flights. This quickly morphed into the first "flex-wing" microlights - an aircraft that utilised the hang glder wing but also had a pod with the cockpit and engine. The pilot would control the microlight by means of a bar that stretched abeam of the aircraft.</p>
        <p>Flex-wing microlights were popular for a long time and are still flown by many pilots, however in modern times fixed-wing microlight designs have emerged as well. The first of these actually emerged not too long after the first flex-wings, however they were still very experimental machines. In the modern day however, fixed-wing microlights are almost indistinguishable from conventional light aircraft, often providing a similar performance for a lower cost than an ordinary light aircraft.</p>
        <h4>GLIDERS</h4>
        <p>Gliders (or sailplanes as they are known in some parts of the world) are light aircraft that fly using natural sources of lift without the use of an engine or other means of propulsion. They are distinctly recognisable by their long and often quite thin wings, allowing them to take maximum advantage of sources of lift such as ridge lift, thermals and mountain wave.</p>
        <p>There are two common ways of getting a glider into the air. The most common method in the UK is the winch launch, where the glider is launched into the air by a long cable that is reeled in quickly, allowing the glider to very quickly accelerate and shoot skywards. In the US, the most common way of getting a glider into the air is to use a powered light aircraft as a "tow-plane", where it tows the glider behind it with a cable. Other methods such as hill launch, bungee launch and even foot launch for some very light types also exist, but are much less common.</p>
