        <h4>AIRCRAFT IN WAR</h4>
        <p>As is discussed more extensively in the "History Of Flight" page, the use of aeroplanes in war was explored almost as soon as the technology arrived. Despite some initial doubts about their uses, less than 10 years after the Wright Brothers took their first flight in 1903, planes were being used in warfare for the first time.</p>
        <p>In this page, we'll be discussing the different types of military aircraft out there and their roles, both in history and on the modern battlefield.</p>
        <h4>FIGHTER AIRCRAFT</h4>
        <p>A mainstay of air forces from (almost) the very beginning, fighters are aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat - which is to say that their primary role is shooting down other aircraft. Fighter aircraft can trace their origins back to WW1, where the initial use of aeroplanes as recon platforms gave way to pilots wishing to deny the enemy an intelligence advantage, by putting machine guns on their aircraft and going after the recon planes. Thus an arms race began, with each side continually trying to gain the upper hand in aircraft technology and leading to the first aerial dogfights.</p>
        <p>In WW2, the roles of fighter aircraft expanded. As bombers became a bigger part of the fight, some fighter designs emphasised long-range endurance and turning capability, allowing them to escort bomber aircraft, whereas some fighters emphasised speed and climbing ability in order to shoot down incoming bombers in an interception role. The concepts of the heavy fighter and night fighter were also explored, with some heavier fighters carrying the first aircraft radars, making them suitable for night-time interception. At the latest stages of the war, jet propulsion was also beginning to make itself known.</p>
        <p>During the Cold War, the age of the jet aircraft was here and fighters became much faster, first breaking the sound barrier and then breaking it twice - even in the 1950s some fighter designs were already capable of flying at Mach 2. The weaponry also changed, with air-to-air missiles beginning to take a larger role as a fighter's primary weapon. Most fighters would also see themselves fitted with radar as well. Once again, some fighters specialised in being more multi-role platforms whereas others emphasised pure speed and altitude as interceptor aircraft.</p>
        <p>As the Cold War came to a close and into the modern day, stealth technology emerged as a game-changer, first in experimental types but now featured in a number of "5th-gen" fighters operated by the US, Russia and China.</p>
        <h4>BOMBER AIRCRAFT</h4>
        <p>Bomber aircraft also emerged in WW1, and the first heavy bombers were built during this war.</p>
        <p>however their first major use was during WW2 and the use of heavy bombers was a major component of multiple battles during that war. Alongside escorting fighters, they often flew in massed formations in missions that were devestating both to those on the ground and in the air - being part of a bomber crew was among the most dangerous roles of the conflict. There were also other types of lighter bomber aircraft as well, such as dive bombers and torpedo bombers.</p>
        <p>As WW2 came to a close and the Iron Curtain emerged, the use of bombers remained a top strategic topic for the major air forces of the world. As ballistic missiles were in their infancy immediately following WW2, the heavy bomber remained for a time the only platform for which to deliver nuclear weapons onto a target, and so a great deal of attention continued to be put into maintaining large fleets of them.</p>
        <p>However, a great deal of research was put into how to make bombs a more precise weapon. During WW2, it took a whole fleet of heavy bombers dropping their bombs on a specific area ("carpet bombing") to have a chance at taking out a desired target, and even then complete misses were not uncommon. Thus, by the time of the Vietnam War, the first precision laser and GPS guided bombs began to emerge. A smaller, nimbler aircraft could now carry one or two bombs and accurately strike a target that it once took a whole fleet of heavy bombers to destroy.</p>
        <p>This, along with the emergence of ICBMs, has meant that heavy bombers are now largely a thing of the past, with the dedicated bomber plaforms that do exist now typically being much smaller and faster. The major nations of the US, Russia and China still maintain small fleets of heavy bombers as part of their nuclear triad.</p>
        <h4>MILITARY HELICOPTERS</h4>
        <p>The operational history of helicopters can be traced back to WW2, with the first mass-produced helicopter being the Sikorsky R-4, a two-seat design used by the US and UK militaries during the war. Initially, helicopters were mainly used in a medivac role, rescuing wounded troops from the battlefield and transporting them back behind the lines for treatment.</p>
        <p>During the Korean War a few years later, helicopters such as the Bell H-13 Sioux and the Bell 47 continued to serve in a medivac role but also performed more of a battlefield recon role as well. However, the first war where helicopters played a major part was the Vietnam War, with the US introducing the concept of "Air Cavalry" - troop regiments that would ride into battle not on horseback, but by helicopter. This war also saw the introduction of the attack helicopter as a concept with designs such as the AH-1 Cobra.</p>
        <p>In the modern day, helicopters play much the same role as they did then, but much more cautiously due to the prevalence of modern surface-to-air missile systems. The Russia-Ukraine War has also shown armed helicopters to be a capable (and relatively low-cost) counter-drone platform - a helicopter with a capable door gunner can shoot down a slow-moving drone much cheaper than even a small SAM.</p>
        <h4>TANKER AIRCRAFT</h4>
        <p>Military air-to-air refuelling aircraft, or tankers, are used to refuel fast jets and other aircraft mid-air during their missions, for the purposes of extending their operational range. These planes are typically modified derivatives of civilian airliners (such as the RAF Voyager, which is a modified Airbus A330).</p>
        <p>These aircraft are vital for allowing other military aircraft to fly their missions without necessarily needing to have friendly assets, such as aircraft carrier or ground airbases, nearby.</p>
        <h4>TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT</h4>
        <p>Heavy lift transport aircraft such as the C-130 and C-17 are used by military forces to carry troops and heavy equipment to bases and battlefield locations both during peacetime and in wartime. Some of these types still utilise propellers (typically turboprops) as propeller engines are actually better for shorter take-offs and landings than jets.</p>
        <p>These aircraft come in all sizes, from small aircraft such as the C-27, to extremely large types such as the C-5 Galaxy. These types also often feature a number of variants for carrying out other missions beyond transport - the C-130 for example has tanker, airborne surveillance, paratrooper and even close-air-support gunship variants.</p>
        <h4>RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT</h4>
        <p>The category of reconnaissance aircraft is a large one and in itself can be broken down into a number of types.</p>
        <p>AWACS - Airborne Warning and Control System - aircraft designed to function as an airborne surveillance platform and also as a command and control asset. Featuring types such as the Boeing E-3 Sentry and E-7 Wedgetail, these are large aircraft that carry very powerful radars and signals intelligence equipment, capable of monitoring air, sea and land for enemy threats. These aircraft will work in conjunction with other more frontline combat aircraft to take on the enemy during wartime.</p>
        <p>Reconnaissance Drones - unmanned aircraft have become a common part of aerial reconnaissance for many militaries. These are typically quite slow-flying, sometimes coming in the form of a quadcopter drone to at their largest being slightly larger than a light propeller aircraft. These offer the advantages of being able to stay in the air for longer than manned aircraft as well as being able to operate in higher-risk areas and missions where aircraft loss is a likely possibility.</p>
        <p>Spyplanes - perhaps the purest definition of a recon aircraft, these planes operate at very high altitudes, typically 70,000-90,000 feet. These aircraft are very expensive to operate and so only large powers such as the US and the Soviet Union operate them. The most famous current example is the Lockheed U-2, a jet-powered aircraft that resembles a very large glider and can operate at up to 70,000 feet. The most famous retired example, and one of the most high-performance aircraft of all time, was the SR-71 Blackbird, a spyplane that was actually designed to counter the SAM threat that befell a couple of U-2 spyplanes. The SR-71 could fly at over three times the speed of sound (Mach 3) and operate at an altitude of 85,000-90,000 feet.</p>
