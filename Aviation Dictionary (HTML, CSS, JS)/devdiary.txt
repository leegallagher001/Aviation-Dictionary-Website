Second day working on Aviation Dictionary website. Created the rest of the pages as well as created some of the responsive design, particularly with regards to navigation menu. 

Things to work on:

- Change navbar from a list to something else, as using a list is causing problems with the responsive design (the bullet point is removed but the empty space where it would have been is still getting in the way).

- Start work on other pages

- Add an API font
