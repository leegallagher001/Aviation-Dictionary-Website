Second day working on Aviation Dictionary website. Created the rest of the pages as well as created some of the responsive design, particularly with regards to navigation menu. 

Things to work on:

- Change navbar from a list to something else, as using a list is causing problems with the responsive design (the bullet point is removed but the empty space where it would have been is still getting in the way).

- Start work on other pages


- Add an API font

Fixed the issue with the .topnav section by removing the ul structure, allowing me to centre the <a> elements properly when the width of the screen is 600px or less (for responsive web design purposes). Also started work on the other pages, particularly the light aviation one. Also added an API font.

Things to work on:

- Continue work on pages

- Start adding some JavaScript (gallery would be a good place to start with this)
